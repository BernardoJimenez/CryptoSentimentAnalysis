# CryptoSentimentAnalysis
The goal of this project is to determine the relationship that current sentiment on a coin has with the price change the next day. I will be using AWS service Comprehend to conduct sentiment analysis and extract the coefficient for Positiveness from the returned JSON file. The sentiment analysis will be done on Reddit discussion submissions on coins, with comment extraction done using the Python Reddit API Wrapper package. Coin prices and price changes will be extracted using CryptoCompare.com's API. Finally, analysis will be done using Pandas/Numpy and visualized with Tableau. If Tableau's free/public tier causes issues presenting my visuals, I'll switch to using Python's Seaborn package.
