# The state of this project thus far is a proof of concept, using the technologies as intended.
# The completed state will incorporate the Reddit API, CoinMarketCap API, and AWS to determine
# how sentiment affects the price change in a coin on a per day basis... Analysis will be
# visualized in Tableau. As I would be using the pubic version of Tableau, if my
# visuals are not able to be exported/downloaded, I'll switch to using the Python package Seaborn instead.
